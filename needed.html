<center><h6 style="color:nevy-blue;font-size:25px;">
All blood types are needed.<br>
 Common blood types are needed because there are many patients with them.<br> 
Less common blood types are needed because there are fewer donors to give them.<br> 
However, people with O- blood are particularly in demand because they are the "universal donor."<br>
 It means that people of all blood types can receive O- blood safely, so it is used during <br>
life-threatening emergencies or when the matching blood type is in short supply. <br>
AB types are universal recipients. This relationship is reversed for plasma products.<br>
 AB type plasma can be transfused to all patients, while O- types are the universal plasma recipients.<br>
 Therefore, all types are really needed!</h6></center>
