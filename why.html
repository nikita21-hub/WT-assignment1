<center><h6 style="color:black;font-size:25px;">
Blood is the part of life that is given to those who need it by those who have the resource to satisfy the need. The love of fellow human and a desire to share<br> 
something of oneself is what singles out a blood donor from the others. Emergencies occur every minute. For each patient requiring blood, it is an emergency <br>
and the patients could have set back if blood is not available.

Your blood donation may be even more special than you realize A single donation from you can help one or more patients. This is possible because whole blood is <br>
made up of several useful components. These components perform special functions in your body and in the body of patients who receive your blood.<br>

Various blood components are Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, Platelets, Plasma and selected Plasma Proteins. Each of these components can be separated from<br> 
your donated volume of blood and transfused into a specific patient requiring that particular component. Thus, many can benefit from one unit of blood. Every <br>
year India requires 40 million units of 250cc blood out of which only a meager 500,000 of blood units are available.</h1>
